# Portfolio-Project

MY ACHIEVMENT & MY LEARNING:

This is a fully responsive portfolio website that I built from the ground up without using any external libraries or frameworks. It highlights my journey, skills, and featured projects in a clean and structured layout.

Designed a smooth, modern interface using pure CSS, with attention to responsive layouts and clean visual hierarchy.

Added basic JavaScript interactivity, such as smooth scrolling and navigation toggle functionality.

Created a simple, user-friendly experience across devices with a focus on performance and readability.

This project demonstrates my foundational front-end skills and serves as a central hub for everything Iâ€™m working on.
